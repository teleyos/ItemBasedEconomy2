# ItemBasedEconomy 2.0 1.16 
It contains the eclipse project file and the jar file
you have to import spigot 1.16.1 and Vault yourself in the project.<br/>
I made it compatible with Vault (yay!)
## Usage
### Commands
/money : gives you the money you got<br/>
/putshop [buying|selling|help] [amount] [1.16 item id] [price] : put a sign-shop with the given data<br/>
/withdraw : display the withdraw GUI<br/>
/deposit : display the deposit GUI<br/>

### Sign shop
exemple : if you do "/putshop selling 15 minecraft:glowstone 65" it will place a sign where you look with "Selling 15 glowstone for 65$" written.<br/>
  if you click on the sign you'll get 15 glowstone and lose 65$ (values are not taken from the sign lines so edit sign won't change it's data)
